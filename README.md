# OSS_final_project
1.What does this project do?

The purpose of the final project is to make a club homepage. Homepage was organized through HTML, CSS, and Java Script, and simple transition effects were added. This homepage was built through Apache2 server.


2.Why is this project useful?

The purpose of the website is to deliver club information. It can be used to feedback our problems by leaving video clips and records of the club members. Players can easily access it at any time and use the information on the homepage. In addition, media query is used to make it available not only for Desktop but also for Mobile.


3.How do I get started?

There are not many clubs with well-established club homepage. Freshmen are all curious about the club, but it is really hard to get information about the club. It is really hard to choose a club after seeing some short sentences posted in the open chat room. The homepage is the best option as a medium for delivering club information for freshmen.
